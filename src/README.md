## Installation
To build this project you need `stack`. If you do, simply invoke `make`, which should build the project and generate `insc_jvm` and `insc_llvm` executables, as described in exercise.

## Structure
This project consists of two executables placed in `src/app` folder: one for JVM, other for LLVM. These executables invoke logic stored in `src/src` folder, where there's library logic and files generated by BNFC (in `Language` folder). `*Consts` files contain constants emitted for JVM and LLVM, and `*Generator` files contain logic which folds program tree and emits instructions.

## Used libraries
No external libraries were used, only basic dependencies:
- base >= 4.7 && < 5
- text
- array
- containers
- process
